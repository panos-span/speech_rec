Answer to Question 2:
Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization (CMVN) is a technique used in speech processing to normalize 
the acoustic features to reduce the effects of different recording conditions and speaker variations.

Purpose of CMVN:

1. Channel Normalization: CMVN helps mitigate the effects of different microphones, recording environments, 
   and transmission channels that introduce systematic distortions to the speech signal.

2. Speaker Normalization: It reduces speaker-dependent variations caused by different vocal tract 
   characteristics, making the recognition system more speaker-independent.

3. Environmental Robustness: It makes the recognition system more robust to varying environmental 
   conditions like background noise, room acoustics, etc.

4. Model Generalization: By standardizing the input features, CMVN helps the acoustic models 
   generalize better to unseen conditions and speakers.

Mathematical Formulation:

For each feature dimension i and each frame t in an utterance or speaker segment, CMVN performs:

x̂_t[i] = (x_t[i] - μ[i]) / σ[i]

where:
- x_t[i] is the original feature value
- x̂_t[i] is the normalized feature value
- μ[i] is the mean of feature dimension i across all frames
- σ[i] is the standard deviation of feature dimension i across all frames

The mean and variance are calculated as:
μ[i] = (1/T) * ∑(t=1 to T) x_t[i]
σ²[i] = (1/T) * ∑(t=1 to T) (x_t[i] - μ[i])²

where T is the total number of frames in the utterance or speaker segment.

After CMVN, each feature dimension has zero mean and unit variance, which makes the features more 
robust to variations in recording conditions and speaker characteristics, and improves the 
performance of acoustic models.

Answer to Question 3:
The number of acoustic frames extracted for each utterance depends on the duration of the audio file. 
With a frame shift of 10ms (standard in Kaldi), a 3-second utterance would produce approximately 300 frames.

The dimension of the MFCC features is 13 in our configuration (12 cepstral coefficients plus energy).
This is determined by the default settings in Kaldi's MFCC extraction.

The exact frame counts for the first 5 utterances in the training set can be seen in the output above, 
showing how many frames were extracted for each utterance and confirming the 13-dimensional feature vectors.
